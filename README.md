# Fabrication of D-Shaped Optical Fiber for Sensing Applications



This project was done as part of my MSc in Electronic Communications and Computer Engineering at the University of Nottingham. It focuses on the fabrication of D-shaped optical fibres for biochemical sensing applications.



## Aim

To design and refine D-shaped optical fibre fabrication systems using acrylic mould encapsulation and wheel polishing, and to enhance their sensitivity for ammonia detection through Layer-by-Layer (LBL) DAR/TSPP deposition.



## What this project includes

- MATLAB Live Scripts for intensity drop analysis and wavelength identification  

- Graphs of wavelength vs intensity (at 650 nm)  

- Layer-by-Layer (DAR/TSPP) deposition setup and data  

- Full MSc Thesis and Presentation slides in `docs/`  



## How to use

1. Open the `.mlx` files in MATLAB.  

2. Run `intensitydropinsinglegraphplustable.mlx` to view the plotted intensity drops.  

3. Run `maximumwavelengthidentifier.mlx` to calculate the maximum wavelength.  

4. Output graphs will appear in the \*\*results/\*\* folder.  



## Results

- Successfully fabricated D-shaped optical fibres with 20% and 50% intensity drops.

- Demonstrated ammonia sensing capability using DAR/TSPP coating.

- Observed wavelength shift around 650 nm for effective sensing.
